  <p>Gather your supplies. You will need coupons,a coupon binder, scissors, store ads, and a calculator. Grab competitor coupons if you have any. Stack your deals by finding manufacturer and store coupons for the same item, which can be found online, in your newspaper or in your neighborhood library. Do your math by deducting the price of the coupon from the price of each item. Makes sure you add up your deals before you go to the store. Have all your deals organized. Don't sweat it if you make a mistake.</p>
