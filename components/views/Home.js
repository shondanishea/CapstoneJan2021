  <h1>Financially Fit</h1>
    <p>Becoming financially fit does not mean that you make a lot of money from your business or job. It simply means that you have financial freedom. When you are financially fit, you can afford to spend whatever you want to spend without having the stress of financial problems later on.</p>
    <p>One of the first thing you should know to become financially fit is your credit. Your credit history. The three major credit bureaus- TransUnion, Equifax, and Experian- collect credit and other information about you. In your credit report, you'll find information like:
    your name, address, Social Security number, credit cards, how much money you owe, if you pay your bills on time or late, and if you filed for bankruptcy.
