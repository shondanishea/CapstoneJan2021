  <h1>Financially Fit</h1>
    <p>Becoming financially fit does not mean that you make a lot of money from your business or job. It simply means that you have financial freedom. When you are financially fit, you can afford to spend whatever you want to spend without having the stress of having financial problems later on.</p>
